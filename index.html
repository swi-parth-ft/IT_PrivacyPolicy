        <p><strong>Child Profiles:</strong> Parents may create child profiles, which include usernames and other non-identifiable information provided by the parent. These profiles are stored under the parent account.</p>

        <h3>b. User Content</h3>
        <p><strong>Stories and Images:</strong> When children create stories and images, this content is stored and linked to the parent account. Parents have access to review and approve or deny content created by children.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and improve the <strong>Imagine Tales</strong> app.</li>
            <li>Personalize user experiences.</li>
            <li>Manage subscriptions and story limits based on your plan.</li>

            <li>Send notifications to parents and children for app activity, such as friend requests, story approvals, and likes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>We may share your information with third parties under the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We work with trusted third parties for data processing, analytics, and subscriptions (e.g., RevenueCat for subscription management). These providers are obligated to protect your information.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance and Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to legal requests, to protect our users, or to enforce our policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p><strong>Imagine Tales</strong> uses third-party services to enhance app functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> We use OpenAI's API to assist with story generation based on user input. Information sent to OpenAI is limited to story prompts and selected character details, and is used solely to generate content within the app. You can review OpenAI's privacy practices in their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Gemini API:</strong> The Gemini API is also utilized for theme and genre customization features within the app. We ensure that data shared with Gemini is limited to the functionality of creating unique story content and does not include personally identifiable information.

        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information. However, no online data transmission is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Parental Control</h2>
        <p><strong>Imagine Tales</strong> provides parental control over children’s activities on the platform. Parents have the ability to review and approve or deny stories and can manage child profiles.
